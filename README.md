Step by step project from TOP with homework assignments in the end.

# Gist
You get to create an app that would create automatic personalized letters for people registered for the conference to remind them to vote for their candidate. The candidate is fetched from Google Civic API and is up to date. The letters are in form of a HTML page with ERB syntax, allowing for fetching the data straight from the ruby code. The assignments were mainly concerned with working with data in CSV format, squeezing some valuable insights from it. 

# Approach
Well, ruby, api, erb, csv and sanitizing the data pretty much.

# What Have I Learned
'#tally' method in ruby, OMG! That was such a revelation and helped to promptly analyze the data and have the output ready in the needed format. The Time class was very useful too with all it's strftime codings and parsings. But of course the main focus was on using API and making THE PAGE PERSONALIZABLE. It's impossible to overestimate the importance of it in the future: every user should have his personal experience based on his personal data.
